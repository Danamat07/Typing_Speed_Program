# Typing Speed Test (WPM)

Description
The Typing Speed Test (WPM) is a simple Java-based program that allows you to test your typing speed. The program generates a series of random words, and you have to type them as quickly and accurately as possible. After you finish typing, it calculates your Words Per Minute (WPM) and provides feedback on how many words you typed correctly and how many mistakes you made.
You can try the test multiple times, and the program will give you the option to retry or exit after each test.
