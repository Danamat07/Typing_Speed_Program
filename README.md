# Typing Speed Test (WPM)
Typing Speed Test (WPM) is a fast-paced, finger-flying, word-slinging challenge that puts your typing skills to the ultimate test! 🖋️⚡💻 Watch as a random assortment of words pops up on your screen, and your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to type them as quickly and accurately as possible. ⏱️🕶️

Think you're a keyboard wizard? 🧙‍♂️⌨️ Prove it! The program calculates your Words Per Minute (WPM) 📝, giving you a breakdown of how many words you nailed ✅ and how many tripped you up ❌. Messed up? 😅 No worries! Hit retry 🔄 to sharpen your skills and aim for a new high score 🏆, or gracefully bow out if your fingers need a rest 💤.

Play again and again to beat your best score, challenge your friends 👯‍♂️, or just show your keyboard who's boss 💪🔥. Ready? Get set… Type like the wind! 🚀💻⚡
